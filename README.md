Fun Tick Tack Toe game
#
I would like to implement a feature that prevents a player from clicking on a square a second time after it already displays an X or O. I would do this by checking for status, and if it was already an X or an O, it would prevent the player from having any effect on the square.

I would also like to implement a feature that makes the game play a sound when a player clicks a square, and make a different sound when the winner has been determined. I'm not sure how I would go about doing this, as I have not implemented any sound features into ay programs that I've worked on thus far. I would like to learn more about doing this in upcoming modules *potentially*.
